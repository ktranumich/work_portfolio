	<p>What are my favorite things to cook? I love to make all sorts of asian foods and desserts. Korean cuisine is currently my fad - it's so easy to whip up a couple of different side dishes and eat them along with rice. I am currently working to cut down my meat intake, and getting some good fruit and vegetable variety from Asian supermarkets has been such a great help! While I still love meat, I have recently felt more determined to make an impact. The ethics behind animal production is deeply concerning, and the amount of emissions released is astonishing.</p>
	<p>When I bake, I love to keep it nice and easy. Recently, I have been deeply invested in Claire Saffitz's YouTube channel and I'm always looking for recipes that can be made by hand. My kitchen is pretty tiny and has no room for fancy equipment like stand mixers, hand mixers, or food processors. Some of the best goodies I have baked so far are chocolate chip cookies, brownies, banana bread, and challa bread.</p>
